 A friend wants to set up a blog and weâ€™ve decided to help out. Our friend wants to use Ghost blog which is a lightweight blogging platform written in Node.js. Seeing it as a useful offering toyour customers, we've decided to create a reusable Terraform file to deploy Ghost blog.

Create main.tf:
Now we can initialize Terraform: terraform init
Execute terraform plan:
terraform plan -out=tfplan \
-var 'container_name=ghost_blog1' \
-var 'image_name=ghost:alpine' \
-var 'ext_port=8080'
Apply the plan: terraform apply tfplan
